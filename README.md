# Dots
An assortment of dot files for my desktop

## Requirements
Not really requirements, but the bunldes that're configured/used in this
 -  i3-gaps
 -  polybar
 -  compton
 -  termite
 -  ncmpcpp
 -  Adapta GTK theme
 -  Paper icon theme

## TODO
Write some util that places all the links correctly and possibly link to systemd?

Other plans are to make said util merge config files together, but that's prob a massive pain.
